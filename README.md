## This is a Weather App in Flask via Python. 

This app will allow a user to input a city and receive the weather from that city for that day. I aim to have this project reference a live database, probably from a weather website, and display it to 
the user. At this current moment, I do not have a front end idea for this, but that can be something I do for the v2 of this project.
